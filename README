Random Cat v2.0 pulls random cat photos from thecatapi.com 
using YQL and displays them in a page designed with Twitter
Bootstrap.

Updates: 
1) Nicer looking interface than v1.0
2) Bug fixed where thecapapi.com gives a link that denies
access

Random Cat has been a great procrastination tool for me. 
Making it was fun. Using it every day for a few minutes as
a coding break has become my habit. People who have used
it tell me it is hard to stop clicking for more cats. I 
hope you will like it, too!

Random Cat currently lives on http://cs.oberlin.edu/~szheng

Future plans:
Random Cat v3.0 should be able to actually fetch cat photos
randomly from a website, instead of asking for one from
thecatapi.com. It should probably work with the Flickr API.

Also, Random Cat deserves its own website, and not just a 
personal webpage provided by my school's computer science 
department.
