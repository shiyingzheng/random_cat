Random Cat v1.0 pulls random cat photos from thecatapi.com 
and displays it in a plain html page. Since thecatapi.com
doesn't seem to provide API key any more, I used YQL to 
access the photo urls.

Random Cat has been a great procrastination tool for me. 
Making it was fun. Using it every day for a few minutes as
a coding break has become my habit. People who have used
it tell me it is hard to stop clicking for more cats.

Random Cat currently lives on http://cs.oberlin.edu/~szheng

Future plans:
Random Cat v2.0 should have a nicer interface. 
Random Cat v3.0 should be able to actually fetch cat photos
randomly from a website, instead of asking for one from
thecatapi.com.
Random Cat deserves its own website, and not just a personal 
webpage provided by my school's computer science department.
